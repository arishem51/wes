/**
 * Graph-based detection of single-file corridors in an OpenTCS path graph, used
 * to emit `SINGLE_VEHICLE_ONLY` blocks so the kernel scheduler serialises lane
 * access. With such blocks the multi-AGV deadlock on a one-lane / dead-end
 * passage becomes impossible at the allocation layer: the scheduler refuses to
 * let a second vehicle allocate any resource of a block another vehicle is in.
 *
 * A corridor is a maximal chain of points whose interior nodes each connect to
 * exactly two neighbours (undirected degree 2) - a physically single-file
 * passage. It is bounded at each end by a junction (degree >= 3, a shared
 * intersection) or a dead-end (degree 1). Only DEAD-END corridors are wrapped in
 * a `SINGLE_VEHICLE_ONLY` block: a vehicle parked at the tip blocks the sole way
 * out for anyone behind it, and the tip vehicle must reverse back through the
 * whole lane to leave, so two vehicles inside inevitably trap each other. Left
 * to the base scheduler on purpose:
 *   - through corridors / rings (both ends are junctions) - no dead-end trap;
 *   - bare junction-junction edges and single-point spurs (not lanes).
 * The block covers EVERY point of the lane, including its mouth junction. The
 * mouth must be inside the block: otherwise a vehicle waiting to enter camps on
 * the mouth (the lane's sole exit) and deadlocks the vehicle reversing out. Each
 * dead-end lane has its own distinct mouth and the feeder aisle is a grid, so
 * holding a mouth while the lane is busy only makes other traffic route around
 * it rather than coupling separate lanes.
 *
 * Direction-agnostic by design: a one-way chain is just as single-file as a
 * two-way one, and reverse travel (`maxReverseVelocity > 0`) does not widen it -
 * so the corridor topology is computed on the UNDIRECTED graph. Locked paths are
 * excluded: vehicles cannot route over them, so they are not part of the
 * traversable topology.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O. Feed it the plant model's paths; get back block definitions to
 * drop into `PlantModelDto.blocks` before pushing to the kernel.
